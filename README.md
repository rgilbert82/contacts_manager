# Personal Planner

This is a simple personal planner app that I made with Rails 4. Features include:

* Users can create and modify accounts.
* Registered users can create and modify contacts.
* Registered users can create and modify notes.
* Registered users can create and modify events.
* Registered users can create and modify todos.
* Notes, events, and todos will appear on the calendar on the associated date.

The calendar was created using the [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar) gem.
